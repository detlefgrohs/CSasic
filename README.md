My explorations into interrupted languages.

I saw this great java program that implemented a simple basic interpreter: https://github.com/munificent/jasic

One of the best ways to learn something is to take apart and put it back together again so I decided to rewrite the code in C#. I am pretty proud of the code that I refactored but is still room for great improvement.

One of the things I have looked and used before for tokening a sequence are regular expressions. I think I may explore that more to overcome some of the limitations with the current tokenizer code.

Going to think about the syntax I want to support and how far I want to go with this.
